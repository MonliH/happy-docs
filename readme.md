# happy-docs

**What's this??**

This repo contains up-to-date docs (as of March 2021) to the [happy](https://github.com/simonmar/happy) haskell parser generator.
The documentation can be seen at [monlih.github.io/happy-docs](https://monlih.github.io/happy-docs).

**Why??**

Because the ["official" docs](https://www.haskell.org/happy/doc/html/index.html) are out of date (and let's be honest, ugly!)
